The project represents a simple client-server application as a chat system with multiple clients. The client and server are connected through sockets, and the server is multi-threaded. To log information to the server console and files, Singleton or Multiton design patterns will be applied. It should always be possible to find all the communications for an entire day: text, IP address, date, and time. The technologies that will be used in the project's development are Java and JavaFX for UI. The Observer design pattern and the MVVM software design pattern will be implemented as part of the solution.
